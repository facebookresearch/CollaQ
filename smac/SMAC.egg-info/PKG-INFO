Description: SMAC - StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge
        
        SMAC offers a diverse set of decentralised micromanagement challenges based on
        StarCraft II game. In these challenges, each of the units is controlled by an
        independent, learning agent that has to act based only on local observations,
        while the opponent's units are controlled by the built-in StarCraft II AI.
        
        The accompanying paper which outlines the motivation for using SMAC as well as
        results using the state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning
        algorithms can be found at https://www.arxiv.link
